# Research and relevant experiences
## January 2022 - May 2025: PhD graduate research
### University of New Hampshire
### Supervisor: Dr. Bonnie Brown
* Compared genomes of wild and cultivated eastern oysters to assess genetic
diversity.
* Assessed Haplosporidium nelsoni and Perkinsus marinus in eastern oysters through
sequencing data.
* Determined gene sequences that contribute to MSX-tolerance in eastern oysters.
* Analyzed epigenetic modifications that could contribute to inherited disease
tolerance.
* Inferred population viability of eastern oyster through theoretical modeling.

## January 2022 - September 2024: Editor
### UNH Research and Large Center for Development 
* Edited large grant proposals for numerous agencies, such as NSF and NIH.
* Worked directly with PI’s to produce successful large-scale funding opportunities.

### Summer 2023: AI Innovation Fellow - Machine Learning Track
#### Stanford University - Inspirit Innovators
* Attended sessions dedicated to advanced AI learning, including concepts,
applications, and live coding.
* Created benthic ecology photo identification program using knowledge gained from
sessions.
* Applied the created AI program into research conducted at the UNH Brown lab.

## August 2020 – May 2022: Medical Laboratory Technician
### UNH COVID-19 Laboratory
### Supervisor: Dr. W. Kelley Thomas
* Performed a variety of routine and specialized medical laboratory diagnostic tests for
the COVID-19 pandemic.
* Optimized laboratory testing to acommodate high-throughput testing.
* Performed RNA extraction, isolation, and rt-PCR in a BS-3 laboratory setting.
* Utilized professional judgment in interpretations of clinical lab results and in
responding to unusual situations.

## Fall 2019 – December 2021: MSc graduate research
### University of New Hampshire
### Supervisor: Dr. Bonnie Brown
* Quantified and identified parasitic infections using qcPCR in Crassostrea virginica.
* Compared parasitic infections in farmed and wild oysters.
* Assessed eastern oyster larval abundance in GBE in conjunction with
physicochemical data.
