I am a postdoctoral researcher jointly supervised by Dr. Nadya Mamoozadeh at North Carolina State University and Dr. Mariah Meek at Michigan State University. My work aims to use genomic tools for rapid identification of tuna species that are of high economic importance. 

I earned my PhD at the University of New Hampshire under the supervision of Dr. Bonnie Brown in the department of biology. Broadly, I studied eastern oyster population genomics and their responses to stressors, such as disease and temporal conditions, using the Oxford Nanopore platform. I earned my MSc in integrative and organismal biology at the University of New Hampshire studying temporal dynamics of eastern oyster larval abundances in Great Bay Estuary as well as infection etiology of MSX and Dermo on eastern oysters. I earned my BS in genetics at Clemson University, with minors in biochemistry and Spanish.

In addition to research, I enjoy creating and volunteering with outreach opportunities. Recently, I designed and successfully deployed an outreach opportunity, titled "Day as a Scientist", which focused on bringing a minority-serving school district to Jackson Estuarine Lab (affiliated with UNH) to conduct their own science experiments, under the supervision of numerous graduate student researchers.
