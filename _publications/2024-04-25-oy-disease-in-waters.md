excerpt: 'In Great Bay Estuary, New Hampshire, USA, Haplosporidium nelsoni and Perkinsus marinus are 2 active pathogens of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin), that cause MSX (multinucleated sphere with unknown affinity ‘X’) and dermo mortalities, respectively. Whereas studies have quantified infection intensities in oyster populations and determined whether these parasites exist in certain planktonic organisms, no studies thus far have examined both infectious agents simultaneously in water associated with areas that do and do not have oyster populations.
