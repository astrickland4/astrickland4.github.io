excerpt: 'Identifying similarities and differences in soundscape properties among coastal marine habitats is valuable for determining indicators of habitat composition, assessing functional connectivity among habitats, and informing management decisions regarding the soundscapes of these habitats. The objective of the current work was to determine whether geographic region or habitat type accounts for more variability in coastal soundscape properties. '
