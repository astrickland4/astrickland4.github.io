excerpt: 'Identifying similarities and differences in soundscape properties among coastal marine habitats is valuable for determining indicators of habitat composition, assessing functional connectivity among habitats, and informing management decisions regarding the soundscapes of these habitats. The “Soundscape Code,” proposed and developed by Dylan Wilford, enables rapid calculation of values for four salient soundscape properties: amplitude, impulsivity, periodicity, and dissimilarity. This enables multivariate statistical analyses to quantitatively compare soundscapes in different habitat types and geographic regions. The objective of the current work was to determine whether geographic region or habitat type accounts for more variability in coastal soundscape properties. Passive acoustic recordings were acquired in three different habitat types (sand, macroalgae, and eelgrass dominated substrates), in each of four different geographic locations along the New Hampshire/Maine coastline, to compare the soundscapes of habitats with varied biological and geophysical substrate composition. Results indicate that geographic location accounted for more variability in the soundscapes than habitat type, suggesting that habitats’ local connectivity outweighs acoustic and biological uniformity of the same habitat type over broader spatial scales. Future analyses will incorporate metagenomic data for predictive modeling of habitat composition through the combined use of passive acoustic monitoring and metabarcoding of seawater samples.'
