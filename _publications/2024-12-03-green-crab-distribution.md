excerpt: 'Great Bay Estuary (GBE) is a complex estuarine system at the convergence of seven rivers, ocean and land. The GBE ecosystem supports typical estuarine species but, like many estuaries, has been a target of both invasive and range-expanding species. The goal of this study was to compare abundance, sex and size distribution of green crabs between oyster farm sites and non-farmed sites within GBE in 2021 and 2022.'
