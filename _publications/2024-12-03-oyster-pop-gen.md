excerpt: 'Eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, are historically a keystone species in many of the estuaries in which they reside, providing critical ecosystem services. Because oyster populations have been on the decline for the past century, restoration initiatives currently are underway in many estuarine systems, including Great Bay Estuary (GBE), New Hampshire. This study aimed to identify the population genomic structure of eastern oysters in GBE to facilitate determination of effective population size and estimation of genetic differentiation among subpopulations.'
